I'm an adjunct researcher at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), working in [Morishima Lab](https://morishima-lab.jp/?lang=en). I received my M.E. degree from the Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, in 2024. My research interests include 3D reconstruction (e.g., Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting).
